							<h1>The Legends of Go</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/GoBoard.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The Legends of Go is based on the longest continuously played board game named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" target="_blank">Go</a>, where two players compete to strategically conquer the most territory.  Go's ruleset is fairly simple, however the strategy behind the game is quite deep.  The Legends of Go aims to incorporate the history of Go, modern AI, and RPG features to create a new experience to be played on PC.</p>
							<hr />
							<h2>Go Rules</h2>
							<p>
								Go is played by two players alternating turns placing black and white stones on the empty intersections of the board grid.  
								The winner of the game is the player that controls the most space on the board.  
								Stones that are connected to eachother act as a group, and stones can also be captured if they become completely surrounded, leaving no empty adjacent intersections.  
								A more in-depth explanation of Go's ruleset can be found on the <a href="https://www.britgo.org/intro/intro2.html" target="_blank">British Go Association's Website</a>.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<h2>Go Gameplay</h2>
							<p>
								In the clip below, you'll see the black and white stone players taking turns walling off territory on the board.  Black is able to claim the right
								side of the board while white has the left.  At the end you'll see the territory marked with black and white dots, to show which portions of the board
								are owned by each player.  Because black gets the advantage to play first, white gets some bonus points to offset this, but black was still able 
								to win as a much larger portion of the board was claimed.  For the sake of keeping the clip short, the 9x9 board was used, and the players are 
								also playing at a fairly rapid pace.  The typical board sizes are 9x9, 13x13, and 19x19, with 19x19 being the most commonly played.
